<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It’s blueberry season so that means one thing, we should all be making these Blueberry Crumb Bars! These are a go-to summer treat for me, I’ve been making them for years and everyone always loves them. They’re easy to make and those fresh blueberries just make them so unbelievably delicious!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup shortening</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
    <li>4 cups fresh blueberries</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup sugar, 3 cups flour, and baking powder. Mix in salt and cinnamon, if desired. Use a fork or pastry cutter to blend in the shortening and egg. Dough will be crumbly. Pat half of dough into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, stir together the sugar and cornstarch. Gently mix in the blueberries. Sprinkle the blueberry mixture evenly over the crust. Crumble remaining dough over the berry layer.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until top is slightly brown. Cool completely before cutting into squares.</li>
</ol>
